## Development
IF you want me to continue improving this EQUATES code generator, THEN e-mail me that you are using **RYBEQUATES**. 
  It might be useful to include your use case scenario for **RYBEQUATES** and a description of how it helps the 
  Return On Investment (ROI) of the business you are involved in working. 
  After all is said and done, information technology is there to support the business goals. 
  And the translation of business goals to automation with information technology is our job.

# RYBEQUATES: Clarion EQUATES code generator (Generador de c√≥digo Clarion EQUATES)

The EQUATES code generation is based on the Clarion template language. You will need to
create the equates template for each type of subject. You have several examples of how to build,
import, and create an EQU file with your equates and a CSV file for future use.
