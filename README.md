## Development
IF you want me to continue improving these templates EQUATES code generators, THEN e-mail me that you are using **RYBEQUATES**. 
  It might be useful to include your use case scenario for **RYBEQUATES** and a description of how it helps the 
  Return On Investment (ROI) of the business you are involved in working. 
  After all is said and done, information technology is there to support the business goals. 
  And the translation of business goals to automation with information technology is our job.

# RYBEQUATES: Clarion EQUATES code generator (Generador de c√≥digo Clarion EQUATES)

The EQUATES code generation is based on the Clarion template language. You will need to
create the equates template for each type of subject. You have several examples of how to build,
import, and create an EQU file with your equates and a CSV file for future use.

This becomes useful when you have to build a system with many types of forms or other objects and have some way of identifying 
these items and use case statements to take coding actions on these different items. Think of a state machine,
every state executes some code, every state has to be identified, and each identity is defined by an EQUATE value.

The [RYB Templates](https://github.com/RobertArtigas/RYB/wiki/Equate-Tables) contain a very simple example. The techniques have been improved
since the original release in those templates. This Template Set contain a bit more sophisticated examples.

Look at the examples on the [Wiki](https://github.com/RobertArtigas/RYBEQUATES/wiki) documentation. 
Specially take a look at the [BUSINESS  EQUATES](https://github.com/RobertArtigas/RYBEQUATES/wiki/The-BUSINESS-Equates) generator template.
That is the most developed EQUATES example generator containing five generated computer languages (Clarion, CSharp, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript) and 
three data sources (CSV, XML, JSON).
